            Paired-end illumina reads to error correct.

        short-hint : |
            Name of error corrected output reads

            Name to save the error corrected reads as.

    # kmer_params : # Selection will determine showing kmer_length, genome_size, and alpha, or just kmer_length and genome_size
    #     ui-name : Parameter Flag
    #     short-hint : Parameters flag
    #     long-hint : The required parameters used for processing. Selection will determine using kmer length, genome size, and alpha, or just kmer length and genome size. 
    #         When using "-K" instead of "-k", Lighter will go through the reads an extra pass to decide C. When using "-K", genome_size should be relatively accurate.

    kmer_length :
        ui-name : K-mer Length
        short-hint : Length of k-mer
        long-hint : The length of the k-mers to be used.

    genome_size :
        ui-name : Genome Size
        short-hint : Size of the genome
        long-hint : The estimated size of the genome. When using "-k" it does not need to be accurate, but it should be at least as large as the size of the sequenced genome. 
            "-K" can also be less accurate, but it should be relatively close to the size of the sequenced genome.

    # alpha :
    #     ui-name : Alpha
    #     short-hint : The sampling rate
    #     long-hint : The sampling rate used in the method. Decided by the user. A rule of thumb is alpha=(7/C), where C is the average coverage of the data set.

    # threads :
    #     ui-name : Threads
    #     short-hint : Number of threads
    #     long-hint : The number of threads to be used for processing. Default is 10.

    # maxcor :
    #     ui-name : Maxcor
    #     short-hint : Maximum correction
    #     long-hint : The maximum number of corrections within a 20bp window. Default is 4.

    # trim :
    #     ui-name : Trim
    #     short-hint : Allow trimming.
    #     long-hint : Allow trimming. Default is false.

    # discard :
    #     ui-name : Discard
    #     short-hint : Discard unfixable reads
    #     long-hint : Whether to discard the sequences. When discarding paired-end matching will be LOST. Default is false.

    # noQual :
    #     ui-name : No Quality
    #     short-hint : No quality socre
    #     long-hint : Ignore the quality socre. Default is false.

    # newQual :
    #     ui-name : New Quality
    #     short-hint : New quality option
    #     long-hint : ASCII quality score. Set the quality for the bases corrected to the specified score. Default is not used.

    # saveTrustedKmers :
    #     ui-name : Save Trusted K-mers
    #     short-hint : Save trusted k-mers file
    #     long-hint : Save the trusted kmers to specified file then stop. Default is not used.

    # loadTrustedKmers :
    #     ui-name : Load Trusted K-mers
    #     short-hint : Load trusted k-mers file
    #     long-hint : Directly get solid kmers from specified file. Default is not used.

    # zlib :
    #     ui-name : Gzip
    #     short-hint : Gzip compression
    #     long-hint : Set the compression level(1-9) of gzip on the processed file(s). Default is not used.

    <p>Lighter is a kmer-based error correction method for whole genome sequencing data. Lighter uses sampling (rather than counting) to obtain a set of kmers that are likely from the genome. Using this information, Lighter can correct the reads containing sequence errors.</p>
